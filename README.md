# project_pet_app
Analyzed 2 years of historical data for an app that connects pet owners with people who would like to take care of pets or provide pet services. Joined 8 tables and made all kind of analysis: how many services were given, how many users we had, how did we acquire users, what is the evolution of the price, etc.
