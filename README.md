# project_pet_app
Analyzed 2 years of historical data for an app that connects pet owners with people who would like to take care of pets or provide pet services. Joined 8 tables and made all kind of analysis: how many services were given, how many users we had, how did we acquire users, what is the evolution of the price, how is customer acquisition changing, what strategies worked vs which didn't, average number of pets in a service, and many other indicators.
